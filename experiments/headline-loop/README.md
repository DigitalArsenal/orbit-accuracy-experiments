# The SDN-AP table (stack #316)

One table per released sdn-ap version (schema `sdn-ap-scoreboard/2`): AP, the theory alone, against a properly configured numerical
propagator and against SGP4-XP of the same module, with the owner's pass line (AP within 100 m of the numerical propagator at 120 h) and
AP's margin over XP as counts, per regime and fit length, on every
precise-orbit window whose numerical rows are in the store, in the module's own GCRF output, errors in meters against the truth. The
site's release tool reads it (`--scoreboard-result <file>`).

## Tools

| File | Does |
|---|---|
| `table.mjs` | fits and flies AP and SGP4-XP of a modules commit (its `propagator/sdn-ap/dist/isomorphic/module.wasm` by `git show`) on every window, scores it, reads the numerical propagator's errors on the same windows from the store, and writes the one JSON (`sdn-ap-scoreboard/1`). AP's rows go to `<store>/table/<wasm sha12>/rows.jsonl` |
| `refly.mjs` | the numerical propagator's rows, flown once (`--second-pass`: the windows touching March to May 2026): FFM 2.2.0 (fitted by analysis/estimation 0.7.0) in the reduced, configured and full settings (and Fbest on the laser geodetic spheres), to `<store>/f0b8352a43f3/` |
| `lib/` | `env.mjs` (package and host checks), `windows.mjs` (windows, truth, scoring bins, weather), `settings.mjs` (the FFM settings), `ffm.mjs` (FFM and estimation hosts), `arms.mjs` (AP and FFM flights), `e2e.mjs` (check helpers) |

Windows come in two passes: the first is every window whose fit arc and 7-day forecast stay clear of March to May 2026; the second is the
windows that touch those months, flown after the first. A regime's second-pass windows enter the table once all their numerical rows are in
the store. Nothing dated after 2026-11-10 is read.

XM's truth and weather readers refuse a modules checkout whose installed host packages differ from XM's registered ones; the tools answer that
guard with the registered versions and record the installed ones in every row (`HEADLINE_LOOP_HOSTS=registered` keeps the refusal).

The store is `/opt/data/sdn-archive/headline-loop` (`HEADLINE_LOOP_STORE`). Each tool's `--check` runs the tool itself as its own process on a
small real slice and asserts on what it writes.

The numerical column of a row is the stored setting with the lowest median 3D error at 168 h over that row's windows; among settings within
1 % of it, the fuller one. It is null ("being measured") until the store holds every window of the row, and null for commercial
geostationary, whose truth holds station-keeping burns that every stored fit runs through.

## Run

```
npm ci                                                        # or, in the stack: node tools/deps-bundle/deps-bundle.mjs attach <this checkout>
node experiments/headline-loop/table.mjs --modules-commit <sha> --modules-root <modules checkout> --out <file> --jobs 14
for k in $(seq 0 7); do nice -n 19 node experiments/headline-loop/refly.mjs --shard $k/8 & done; wait                 # numerical rows, first pass
for k in $(seq 0 7); do nice -n 19 node experiments/headline-loop/refly.mjs --second-pass --shard $k/8 & done; wait   # and the second
node experiments/headline-loop/table.mjs --check
node experiments/headline-loop/refly.mjs --check
```
